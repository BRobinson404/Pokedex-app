# Pokédex Web App

## Description

This is my first responsive web application! I developed it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of my student portfolio for CareerFoundry’s Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

The app fetches data from PokéAPI to display Pokémon as a list of buttons, each of which triggers a modal when clicked on to show its Pokémon's details (image, name, height and types). The search function filters pokémon names.
